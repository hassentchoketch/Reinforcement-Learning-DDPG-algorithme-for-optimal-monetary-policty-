# Replication of the paper "Optimal Monetary Policy Using Reinforcement Learning"
This project attempts to replicate and verify the results and finding of the following paper [N Hinterlang,A Tanzer(2021) "Optimal monetary policyusing reinforcement learning",Discussion Paper,Deutsche Bundesbank No 51](https://d-nb.info/1248317343/34) using python .

## Current Status
This project is currently a work in progress and is not yet complete. We are still in the process of replicating the results presented in the paper and fine-tuning our implementation.

Future Work
Once our implementation is complete, we plan to evaluate the performance of our approach on additional datasets and compare it to traditional models of monetary policy. We also hope to explore extensions and variations of the approach presented in the paper.
